### Adding new subprojects

To request introduction of a new subproject, use the "Add Project Request" issue template in this repository.

To resolve the created ticket, a PR must be merged by a working group admin, which edits the "Subprojects" section of this document.
The PR will be merged on WG approval.


### Standards for subprojects

When adopting a subproject, the WG agrees that a specific set of criteria will be maintained by the WG.

These criteria are:
* Build passes against ROS 2 master
* The ROS 2 standard linter set is enabled and adhered to
* Builds have 0 warnings
* Quality builds are green (address sanitizer, thread sanitizer, clang thread safety analysis)
* Test suite passes
* Code coverage is measured, and non-decreasing level is enforced in PRs
* Issues are responded to promptly
* Releases go out regularly when bugfixes or new features are introduced


### Deprecating subprojects

Sometimes, project may cease to be useful, or their maintainers may leave.
We do not want to commit to maintaining every project that has ever been added here forever.
To request removal of a subproject, use the "Remove Project Request" issue template in this repository.

To resolve the created ticket, a PR must be merged by a working group admin, which edits the "Subprojects" section of this document.
Additionally, if the repository lives in the `ros-tooling` organization, it will be transferred or deleted out of the organization.
The PR will be merged on WG approval.

## WG Approval / Voting

This Working Group aims to operate by consensus.
Issues needing a group decision will be discussed at the recurring meeting.
When consensus cannot be reached, decisions should in most cases be made by resource commitment: e.g. if a member wants to dedicate their resources to the completion of a goal, then they may do so.
In cases where consensus cannot be reached and resource commitment is insufficient or inappropriate, simple majority voting is used, with each member having one vote.


## Modifying this governance document

Changes to this document will be made via Pull Request.
The PR will be merged on WG approval.
